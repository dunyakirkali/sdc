We hope you will enjoy working with your LanBox.</p>					<p>What is in this manual?<br>						This manual is divided into seven chapters. The first part is a brief introduction and how to setup the box for LCedit+. Part 2-5 describes the most common commands of LCedit+. In the last three parts, more advanced operations, including visualizing with <b><a href="http://www.capturesweden.com/" target="_blank">Capture</a></b>, are shown.</p>					<p>Note: The LCedit+ was designed for the Macintosh platform (including OS X, as picture shows), but we also have a Windows 2000/XP version.&nbsp;<br>																		&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>What is LCedit+?</b></p>					<p>LCedit+ is a computer program for editing the light cues, sequences and shows inside the LanBox. In other words, LCedit+ is just a friendly way to program the LanBox, all the &quot;real&quot; lighting work is done by the box. The program has several types of windows: Stage (that holds the fixtures and light groups), Cast (lists all used fixtures and groups as a list), Control (for light-, and layer- sequencer control, setting layer and chaser parameters ), Cuelist editor (for creating &amp; editing of cues, including  paths and patterns), and Monitor (to monitor various in/out values) .<br>						<br>													LCedit+ also has several built-in tools e.g. to edit the fixture library, to manage files (Utilities, Backup and Restore), to upload firmware, to edit global settings of a LanBox (e.g. set name, password) and to make patches (DMX channels, curves, slope limits, etc.). In order to make fast usage for power users possible, LCedit+ also has a CLI (Command Line Interface), user definable presets, key sequences, macros etc.<br>						<br>						Besides being a light editing program LCedit+ can be used to trigger light scenes and queues during performances. If you need a more specific run time control program (i.e. jingle machine with light queues) , you can use a MIDI sequencer (like Performer or Logic), use a show control program or built your own one with <a href="http://www.cycling74.com/" target="_blank">MAX</a> (examples are included).<br>																		&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>System requirements</b></p>					<p><b>Mac</b><br>Any PPC Macintosh running OS 8.6 or later, 16 bit color screen 800x600, 12 MB free RAM, LocalTalk port (or Ethernet and an iPrint-LT Ethernet to LocalTalk adapter). G3 or better and 1024x768 16 bit color screen recommended. A free serial port (or USB to serial adapter) can be used instead of the network connection as well. For LanBox-LCX you need to have a free USB port. For LanBox-LCE you must have a free Ethernet 10-BT port.</p>					<p><b>PC</b><br>Any Pentium PC, Windows 2000/XP, 16 bit color screen 800x600 (1024x768 recommended), a free serial port (or USB to serial adapter). For LanBox-LCX you need to have a free USB port. For LanBox-LCE you must have a free Ethernet 10-BT port.<br>																			&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>Setup and Install</b></p>					<p>Before you can use LCedit+ the LanBox needs to be setup for a certain hardware configuration, for instructions see the LanBox-LC v2 manual for the LC or the LanBox user manual for the LanBox-LCM, LCE and LCX.</p>					<p><b>Upgrading from LanBox-LC II to LanBox-LC+, so LCX, LCE and LCM users, skip this paragraph!<br>						</b>We understand you are in a hurry, but please read this paragraph, it saves you and us a lot of trouble;-) So, <b>before upgrading</b> to the LanBox-LC+ firmware please read the following steps:<br>						1. Back up ALL scenes of your current LanBox-LC II with LCtools, they will be lost!<br>						2. Be sure you remove your LanBox from the Chooser-&gt;CDS devices-&gt;List, or better disable the extension &quot;CDS Devices&quot; with the extension manager, and restart your Mac.<br>						3. You need to upload the LC+ firmware into the box. The following procedure can also be used to revert back to the LCII firmware if needed or to install new firmware:</p>					<ul>						<li>Choose the &quot;Tools-&gt;Upload Firmware...&quot; menu command and in the upload dialogue, click &quot;Update&quot;.<br>												<li>Choose the &quot;LC+(v3) firmware v1.06.dat&quot; file, the upload procedure is starting.<br>												<li><b>WAIT UNTIL UPLOADING IS COMPLETELY FINISHED!</b>						<li>After clicking the OK button, your LanBox will reconnect and the &quot;interface Status&quot; (Control window, click advanced triangle) should now list e.g. &quot;LanBox-LC+, v1.06					</ul>					<p><br>						&nbsp;<b>If you are going to use USB with LCedit+ and a LanBox-LCX on Windows, you need to install &quot;CDS USB modem&quot; driver.<br>						</b>There are two driver sets in the LCedit/Usbsetup directory; one for Win98SE and one for Win2000/XP. Please copy the appropriate set to a floppy in drive A, so Windows can find them. Once you plug-in the USB cable, windows ask you to install software for new hardware, be sure you are doing this &quot;manual&quot; by letting windows search drive A!<br>					</p>					<p></p>					<p>					&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>The Configure Interface window</b></p>					<p><img src="Images/TCP-connections.jpg" alt="TCP/IP connections" height="236" width="250" align="right" border="0"><img src="Images/serial-connections.jpg" alt="Serial connections" height="236" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">After starting LCedit+ and opening a New project, this is the first window you will see. The editor needs to know what kind of interface you want to use, in order to communicate with a LanBox. <b>Note:</b> On OS X or Windows, only serial ports or TCP/IP can be used.</p>					<p><b>Note: </b>If you want to connect via TCP/IP (LanBox-LCX, LCE), the default IP is 192.168.1.77 (mask is 255.255.255.0) so your computer should be set to any other IP in the 192.168.1.xx range.<br clear="all">						&nbsp;</p>					<p>Select the medium, port(s) or name, for AppleTalk and TCP/IP you can optionally save your password. Now give it a descriptive name , select the &quot;Connect&quot; checkbox and click &quot;OK&quot;. The settings will be stored in your project file, in order to connect instantly when you double click the saved project file.</p>					<p><b>Note:</b> If you wish to try LCedit+ without a LanBox, you can try to use our demo LanBox (if it is not in use) via the Internet. In that case you need to select TCP/IP and use the name demo.lanbox.com, with password 777. (you need to have access to the Internet in order to use our demo box).</p>					<p><a href="Images/empty.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="Images/empty-med.jpg" alt="Empty setup" height="384" width="512" align="left" border="1" hspace="5"></a>After clicking OK, LCedit+ will try to establish a connection with your LanBox. On a network connection it will ask for a password, use 777 as it is the default password of a LanBox. If everything goes well, you will see a green square in the bottom right half of the control window.</p>					<ul>						<li>Put the network name of your LanBox in the name field e.g. LanBox 1, so you know which LanBox you are using in this project (even when it changed to e.g. serial).						<li>Once the connection is made, and your layout looks like the picture left, save the project (File menu-&gt; Save As..).											</ul>					<p><br clear="all">&nbsp;<br>						<b>Note for LC users:</b> If you don't see anything in the &quot;Layer control&quot; list, like above, use the Layer menu command &quot;New Layer&quot;, and select it in the list just below the &quot;Go&quot; button.</p>					<p>TIP: Subscribe to the LanBox-Talk e-mail discussion list, see our <a href="http://www.lanbox.com/support/lists.html" target="_blank">lists</a> page.</p>					<p>&nbsp;<br clear="all">													&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;									</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="750">					<div align="center">						<b><a href="chapter2.html">To next section</a>&nbsp;</b>						<p>																		&nbsp;<a href="chapter1.html"><b>Connect</b></a><b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter2.html">Stage</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter3.html">Control</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter4.html">Cues</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter5.html">Show</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter6.html">Fixtures</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter7.html">Keys</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter8.html">UDP</a>&nbsp;</b></p>						<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>					</div>				</td>			</tr>		</table>		<table width="750" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">			<tr>				<td colspan="2" valign="top">					<hr noshade size="1">				</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="135" valign="top"><font size="1">Last updated: 20-04-2005<br>																																			by:&nbsp;Fokko</font></td>				<td valign="top" width="465"><font size="1">Copyright 1995..2005 CDS advanced technology bv.
