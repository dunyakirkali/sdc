When your fixture is not in the library, use the nearest model, place separate generic channel fixtures, or create your own fixture with the library editor.</p>					<p>The fixtures (or groups) can be created, deleted and duplicated with menu commands and shortcuts. Selecting an item instantly changes the content in the control panel, reflecting the state of the fixture or group. Once a fixture or group is selected (e.g. with the k1 command) you can navigate selections by using cmd-opt- arrow up/down (on PC ctrl-alt-arrow up/dwn), you can even extent the selection by also pressing the shift key.</p>					<p>When you hold the control key, the stage enables a popup menu with commands to Cut, Copy, Paste and clear the background picture. The background can be moved with option(alt)-control drag on the background picture.</p>					<p><i>Stage picture: <a href="http://www.midilite.com/" target="_blank">Jon Daggett, Midilite</a></i><br clear="all">						&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>Place fixtures</b></p>					<p><img alt="view options" height="124" width="100" src="Images/fixtview.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">As we are still staring to a complete empty stage, it's time to do some rigging (place fixtures). To keep it simple we are going to place just eight single dimmers, so here we go.</p>					<p><img alt="fixture setup1" height="251" width="250" src="Images/fixt1.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Do the menu command &quot;New fixture&quot;, you will get a dialog window like the picture left. Select &quot;Generic single dimmer channel&quot;, name it L01, and close the dialog. The stage has now one large icon called {1} L01.</p>					<p>Select this icon and use the &quot;View&quot; menu command to change the appearance to &quot;small icon + full indicators&quot;. Now do the Edit menu command &quot;Duplicate Item&quot; 7 times, you have now eight fixtures on your stage labeled {1}L01 through {8}L08.</p>					<p><img alt="8 fixt stage" height="63" width="250" src="Images/fixt1-8.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">Move the icons (by click-drag) in such a way that you get about the same as the picture right.&nbsp;<br clear="all">						&nbsp;</p>					<hr noshade size="1">					<div align="center">						<p><b>More view options</b></p>					</div>					<ul>						<li><img alt="rgb fixt stage" height="222" width="200" src="Images/fixtview3.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">From v3.3 it's also possible to view the color of a RGB fixture or the actual intensity of a fixture, and you can hide labels as shown on the picture right.						<li><img alt="view options" height="124" width="100" src="Images/fixtview2.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5">The view menu has the following options: 						<ul>							<li>Set the icon size to small instead of normal.							<li>Hide icon (label is shown).							<li>Hide label (icon is shown).							<li>Show the intensity, position, color, whatever is appropriate for the fixture.							<li>Show/hide fixture numbering in label.							<li>Lock/unlock the position of fixture.						</ul>						<li>These view options are very useful when dealing with modern RGB LED matrix setups, but also for e.g. a line of pars (lower 8 fixtures).<br clear="all">											</ul>					<p>						<hr noshade size="1">					</p>					<div align="center">						<p><b>Some important notes:</b></p>					</div>					<ul>						<li>Place single channel fixtures (use RGB fixtures for LED panels) even if you use multi channel dimmer packs, or multi RGB panels! The multi channel packs in the library are intended for unknown multi channel fixtures, not for dimmer packs.						<li>You do not to fill in the blank channel and DMX fields, as they will be assigned automatically. Only if you want have the fixture at a certain light channel or DMX address, you can overrule the auto placement.						<li>The idea is to organize your fixtures in a way you can find them quickly and represents the real stage. When fixtures are placed on the stage there are assigned to channel numbers, but that can be changed in the fixture setup.						<li>Do not change the channel numbers once you have created cues, but use the &quot;Edit Item&quot; command of a fixture to match the DMX addresses of the fixtures with channels.					</ul>					<hr noshade size="1">					<p><b>Groups</b></p>					<p><img alt="group setup" height="179" width="200" src="Images/group1.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">It's nice to have your fixtures on the stage window, but you also want to organize your lights in groups related to function. In our example we make one group of all 8 fixtures.</p>					<p>First select fixture L01, then use shift click to add the other 7 fixtures to the selection (make sure that the order of shift clicking is the same order as your fixtures.) When all 8 fixtures are selected, do the &quot;Edit&quot; menu command &quot;Make Group&quot;, you will get a dialog window like the picture right. Name this group &quot;GL1&quot;, check that all 8 fixtures in order in the right list, and click OK.</p>					<p>LCedit+ allows you to create almost any combination of (sub-) grouping in any way you want. Just select one or more fixtures (but also previous defined groups are allowed) and do the command &quot;Make Group&quot;. When groups are placed on the stage they are assigned to merge and show only &quot;Identical&quot; panels, but also show intensity channels separately for easy overview.<br clear="all">						&nbsp;</p>					<p><img src="Images/Scrnchapter2.jpg" alt="screen chapter 2" height="384" width="512" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">In order to prove that the group GL1 is correct, select the group icon. If all went OK, your screen will look like the screen picture left, meaning we are ready to control some lights.</p>					<p>As you can see, the control window does show now a big Intensity wheel for the whole group, and 8 smaller wheels named L01-L08 for each individual fixture. Also, the Cast window (the top middle) now has 8 rows with the fixture name, it's light channel number, it's DMX address, and the used interface.</p>					<p>Selecting fixtures can be done on the stage, but also in the cast list. The cast list has the advantage that you can have it sorted on e.g. light channel numbers.<br clear="all">					</p>					<p>&nbsp;</p>				</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="750">					<center>						<b><a href="chapter1.html">To previous section</a>&nbsp;| <a href="chapter3.html">To next section</a>&nbsp;</b>						<center>							<p>																		&nbsp;<a href="chapter1.html"><b>Connect</b></a><b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter2.html">Stage</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter3.html">Control</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter4.html">Cues</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter5.html">Show</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter6.html">Fixtures</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter7.html">Keys</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="chapter8.html">UDP</a>&nbsp;</b></p>							<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>						</center>					</center>				</td>			</tr>		</table>		<table width="750" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">			<tr>				<td colspan="2" valign="top">					<hr noshade size="1">				</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="135" valign="top"><font size="1">Last updated: 20-04-2005<br>																													by:&nbsp;Fokko</font></td>				<td valign="top" width="465"><font size="1">Copyright 1995..2005 CDS advanced technology bv.
