Below you find an overview of the keys and their actions. Once you know these key commands (together with user defined keystroke commands), you can do extremely fast complex commands.

The CLI interface was made for it, and also in order to make a single keystroke (see keystroke editor and macros) doing a whole bunch of actions. As soon as you type a CLI character the CLI interface is activated, until an end of sequence command is received. </p>					<p>The allowed CLI commands are described in the single key actions overview at the beginning of this chapter.<br clear="all">						&nbsp;</p>					<p><img src="Images/cliafter.jpg" alt="cli after" height="156" width="160" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">The Command Line Interface is a powerfull system to get actions done by typing very short commands. Look to the right two pictures; the k1-3k5-8 selects fixtures 1-3 and 5-8, while next command ps2 sets them to 100% intensity.</p>					<p>A sequence must end with enter/return/space/tab, while esc cancels the command. clear clears command except the first letter. Multiple commands are allowed, but must be separated by a semicolon. For parameters the dash is allowed for a range, while comma can be used for separate parameters.  <br clear="all">												&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>Macros</b></p>					<p><img src="Images/macros.jpg" alt="macros" height="38" width="200" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">With CLIs you have a fast way to control LCedit+, but what if you want to have a short way for sending commands to the LanBox (like setting the chaser, clearing an engine, etc)? The answer is Macros. A macro is a recorded sequence of lanbox commands, this means any command which can be send to the LanBox, can be recorded. </p>					<p>Recording a macro is initiated (and ended) by the menu command Tools-&gt;Record Macro. A macro may contain up to 20 LanBox commands. When you end the recording, you will be asked a name for the macro. This name popups in the command macros lists on the control window (see picture). A macro can be started by selecting it from the list, and click on the Run button. A fast way to run e.g. macro 2 is typing m2 (see CLI commands). Macros can be deleted with the Tools-&gt;Delete Macros... menu command.&nbsp;<br>																								&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>The keystroke editor</b></p>					<p><img src="Images/keystrokeeditor.jpg" alt="keystroke editor" height="237" width="300" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">With CLIs you have a fast way to control LCedit+, and with the addition of macros you can actually control anything with CLIs, but... </p>					<p>If you want just a single keystroke in order to simulate some CLIs, you can use the built-in keystroke editor to assign one key to do CLI commands.</p>					<p>The keystroke editor allows you to assign very unusual key combinations (like control-alt-shift-F3). Single keystrokes are also a must if you want to use very handy hardware button, jog, shuttle USB devices, like the <b><a href="http://www.contourdesign.com/" target="_blank">Shuttle Pro</a></b> of Contour. <br clear="all">						&nbsp;</p>					<div align="center">						<hr noshade size="1" width="750">						<b>The backup files</b></div>					<div align="left">						<p>Backup files are located inside a box &amp; date directory (like &quot;Demo-LCX-2 [2003.10.03.1403]&quot;, while these directories are located inside the &quot;backup files&quot; directory. The file type of backup files are tab separated text files. The advantage of the text files is that backup files can be read into any word processor and particularly into spreadsheet programs. This also makes it possible to make custom software that creates backup files, and the files can be read/edited in a spreadsheet program. If you save the spreadsheet file as a tab separated text file, they can be uploaded to the LanBox with restore. </p>						<p>A backup file is a tab separated text file. Each line contains data for a scene, each column contains data for a DMX channel. Each line is terminated with a &lt;CR&gt; ($0D). </p>						<p>The header, the first row, contains global information about the file. It consists 10 columns, with the following data: v2.00, LanBox name, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, cuelist HSB, cuelist LSB. After the first 10 columns the columns are filled with the numbers of used DMX channels (in ascending order) in this cuelist. </p>						<p>After the header a number of rows follow. Each row contains data of one cuestep, including the step action data. The first item in each line is the step number, preceded by the step type code and its 6 parameters (see LanBox reference manual page 82). Column 9 indicates whether it is absolute scene data (0), or relative scene data (1), and column 10 is empty. </p>						<p><b>Note:</b> The cuestep numbers must be consecutive, otherwise LCedit+ can't restore the file. When generating a LanBox-LC+ backup file from a custom made program, you can best use the save option 'save range'. </p>						<hr noshade size="1" width="750">						<br>						&nbsp;</div>					<p>This concludes this chapter.
