First a production reason, 5-pole DMX connector are (maybe were) not available in printed circuit versions. This would make 5-pole pole connectors expensive for production. Secondly, many of our (multimedia) customers use mainly Martin intelligent light systems and therefore can connect without having problems.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Can I use the LanBox-LC with 5-pole DMX connectors.<br>					<b>A:</b> Yes, 3-pole XLR or 5-pole DMX connectors only have different pin assignments, the DMX protocol is the same. A simple patch cable will do the trick. Refer to <a href="chapter2.html#6">chapter 2 of this manual</a> for details.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> What's the difference between the old (1996/97) LanBox-LC and the current LanBox-LC ?<br>					<b>A:</b> The hardware is the same, the software is totally different. The old LanBox-LC did not support transitions, had only 50 channels and had a lot less scenes. the LCedit program is totally different. If you have the old manual you'll get an idea how much has changed.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Why does the front of the LanBox-LC say &quot;50 channel DMX controller&quot;. I thought it controlled 250 channels?<br>					<b>A:</b> As mentioned earlier, the Hardware of the LanBox-LC is the same as it predecessor, which could only control 50 channels. The front is an remnant of the first version. Don't worry if you have bought your LanBox-LC after February 1997, you have a 250 channel version.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> How do I know if the LanBox-LC software (firmware) is running?<br>					<b>A:</b> On the front of the LanBox-LC you'll find a yellow LED. This LED should be blinking at a rate of 20 times a second and indicates that a DMX frame is send. If it is blinking, the software in the LanBox-LC (firmware) is running.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Where can I find the latest version of the LanBox software?<br>					<b>A:</b> Our web site (<a href="http://www.lanbox.com/">http://www.lanbox.com/</a>) is the only source where you can find the latest versions of our software. Be sure to check it out. After the release of LanBox-LC, we've started projects for additional software, tools and upgrades. All these tools can be downloaded for free.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Can I change the name of my LanBox-LC, or its password?<br>					<b>A:</b> Yes, with LCtools or LCedit+.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Can I use the LanBox-LC as a protocol convertor?<br>					<b>A:</b> Yes you can, but you'd be using only a fraction of its capabilities. You can use the LanBox-LC as an AppleTalk to DMX, serial to DMX and MIDI to DMX convertor. We've also created some additional software (MAX external objects/XCMDs) that make it easy to control the DMX stream directly from the Mac, from the MAX environment and programs that support XCMDs (like HyperCard, check out our demo stack for details).</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Can I use the LanBox-LC with Windows?<br>					<b>A: </b>Yes, you can communicate with the LanBox-LC through a standard serial protocol and therefore from Windows 95/98 (or NT, 3.11, DOS). Currently we only have PC (Windows 98) version of LCedit+.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Can I use Windows 95 and Director and the LanBox-LC?<br>					<b>A:</b> Yes, from Director you can sent characters to the serial port and so control the LanBox-LC.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Can I use the LanBox-LC from another computer platform (e.g. Linux)?<br>					<b>A:</b> Any computer that can handle a serial connection (RS422/RS232) at 38400 (or 19200 or 9600) BAUD can supervise the LanBox-LC.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Can I upload new firmware using the serial protocol?<br>					<b>A:</b> Yes, it is possible to upload new firmware into the LanBox-LC using the serial protocol, but only with LCedit+.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> Do you have a program for triggering light queues from QuickTime movies<br>					<b>A:</b> Check out the Jingle Machine example in de development folder. Way cool.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> What should I do if the LanBox-LC software is not running?<br>					<b>A:</b> First try to turn the power off and after a couple of seconds back on again. The LanBox-LC should startup its program now. If it doesn't, you need the LCtools program or LCedit+ to (re-) load the LanBox-LC firmware back into the LanBox-LC and start it again (When it asks for a password in this situation, enter nothing!). This situation however, should never occur. The LanBox-LC will store it's program in non-volatile memory and this should not be erased. If you're experimenting with cables for the serial port and, accidentally, short-circuited some of the pins, this could lead to stopping the LanBox-LC firmware. In this case you should be able to correct the problem by restarting the LanBox-LC .</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> When I restart the LanBox-LC, a couple of minutes later my Macintosh tells me there is a problem with the LanBox-LC II. If I go to the chooser and click on the list it tells me that the LanBox-LC is not on the network, but it is. Why is this?<br>					<b>A:</b> If you restarted the LanBox-LC you must go to the chooser and choose the LanBox-LC again. The LanBox-LC does not remember to which Mac it was connected and therefore does not try to reconnect. This behavior may change in the future. For now, please accept it as it is.</p>					<p>&nbsp;<br>					&nbsp;</p>					<p>&nbsp;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="135">&nbsp;</td>				<td width="465"><b><a name="2"></a>FAQ about DMX</b>					<p><b>Q:</b> LCedit II seems to be working, but my lighting equipment does not seem to be working. It's reacting very strangely to LCedit II. What's causing this?<br>					<b>A:</b> DMX is a standard protocol for lighting equipment. Unfortunately three different kind of cables and connector are used to carry the protocol. All these types of cables can be used in a mixed fashion, but it's very hard to find out what's wrong when it's not working. There are two kinds of connectors in use; 3-pole and 5-pole. The LanBox-LC uses the 3-pole connector. See also <a href="chapter2.html#6">chapter 2 of this manual</a>. If you're using all 3-pole cable and it doesn't work, you'll probably need to swap pin 2 and 3. It's a drag, we know, but there's not a lot we can do about it.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> I have some fixtures which are not in the list of LCedit II, can I still use LCedit II?<br>					<b>A:</b> The predefined fixtures are just a nice graphical representation, but for fixtures which are not in the list you can always use the so called &quot;Generic&quot; fixture panels.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> How do I set the address of my DMX equipment?<br>					<b>A:</b> Most DMX equipment have a set of DIP switches to set the address.</p>					<p><b>Q:</b> First my DMX equipment worked fine with the LanBox-LC. I added some new equipment and now it doesn't work at all. What can be wrong?<br>					<b>A:</b> The number of DMX devices you can attach to a DMX chain is limited (max. 32) as is the total cable length (depending on the quality of the cable, you should not exceed the 100 to 150 meters mark). If you need more equipment on the DMX chain or more cable length, you'll need a DMX repeater.</p>					<p>&nbsp;<br>					&nbsp;</p>					<p>&nbsp;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="135">&nbsp;</td>				<td width="465"><b><a name="3"></a>Technical specifications</b>					<p>					<table width="450" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">Dimensions&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">166 x 104 x 65 mm&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">Ambient temperature&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">0...40 degrees Celcius&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">230 V ac adapter output&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">12Vac&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">DC power supply (optional)&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">11...18 Vdc&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">Power consumption&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">max. 5 VA&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td colspan="2" valign="top"><b>This device complies with the European low voltage directive and the European EMC directive, according to the following standards:&nbsp;</b></td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">Electrical safety&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">EN60950&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">Emission&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">EN55022 class B<br>								EN60555&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="50%" valign="top">Immunity&nbsp;</td>							<td width="50%" valign="top">EN500082-1&nbsp;</td>						</tr>					</table>					</p>					<p>&nbsp;</p>					<p><b>FCC</b><br>					This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a class A digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules.
