With the LanBox-LC you've bought a modern desktop DMX lighting controller that can compete with the best. We hope you will enjoy working with the LanBox-LC.</p>					<p>What's in this manual?<br>					This manual is divided into five parts. The first part is a brief introduction, the second part describes how to setup the box and it's software. Part three describes how the LanBox and the firmware actually works. The fourth part explaines how to use the box with MIDI or ASCII commands. The last part has trouble shooting, tip&amp;tricks and specifications.</p>					<p>The LanBox-LC was designed for the Macintosh platform, but can also be used from any other platform (Windows, Linux) using the serial port or MIDI. The serial port can be used to operate and or trigger the LanBox-LC from within, for example, multimedia or MIDI application.</p>					<p>&nbsp;<br>					&nbsp;</p>					<p><b><a name="1"></a>What's packed with the box?</b></p>					<p>What exactly do you get when you buy a LanBox-LC and what do you need in addition? The main part is the LanBox-LC itself. This small black box harbors a complete DMX controller &amp; sequencer, for up to 250 DMX channels. On the front of the sturdy black box you'll find (from left to right) two power supply inputs, a serial connector (for MIDI or serial communication), two RJ11 network connectors and a DMX (3-pole XLR) connector.</p>					<p>Bundled with the LanBox-LC is a CD which contain MacOS and Windows software, manuals and some examples. The software comes on a dual platform CD, so it's readable from Mac as well from Windows systems. The Mac bundle includes the LanBox-LC+ software package, LanBox-LCII software package, documentation and MAX and Hypercard examples. The Windows bundle includes the LanBox-LC+ software package and documentation.</p>					<p>Also in the box you'll find a network cable (RJ11 to RJ11) for the network connection from your LanBox-LC to your Macintosh, a 3-pole DMX terminator (to terminate the end of the DMX chain, and a network RJ11 terminator. The 230V to 12V power adapter needed for the LanBox-LC is also included.</p>					<p>&nbsp;<br>					&nbsp;</p>					<p><b><a name="2"></a>What's not packed with the box?</b></p>					<p>For connecting the DMX lighting equipment to the LanBox-LC you need a DMX cable with 3-pole XLR connectors. This cable is not supplied with the LanBox-LC, but one should be supplied with every DMX device.</p>					<p>For the network connection with your Macintosh you'll need a PhoneNET (or compatible) adapter at the Macintosh side. The LanBox-LC has the RJ11 connectors on the front panel, so the network cable can be plugged in directly. If you already have a AppleTalk/PhoneNET network (for your printer for example), you can plug the LanBox-LC into it.</p>					<p><b>Note:</b> If your Mac only has an Ethernet port, you need an Ethernet to LocalTalk bridge. The <a href="http://www.farallon.com/">Farallon</a> iPrint-LT, or the <a href="http://www.asante.com/">Asante</a> AsanteTalk will suffice.</p>					<p>If your main voltage is anything other than 230V/50Hz you'll need an additional power adapter. The power adapter should provide 12V AC or DC at 300mA. Maximal power consumption of the LanBox-LC is 5W. The 12V adapter should have a 5.5 mm type connector. It's also possible to connect a 11...18V DC source to the (screw-) connector.</p>					<p>If you want to work with MIDI, you'll need to order our LanBox &lt;-&gt; MIDI adapter cable or a simple Macintosh MIDI adapter. We tested the &quot;Midiface SX&quot;, &quot;Apple MIDI&quot; adapter, the &quot;MIDI Translator II&quot; by Opcode Systems Inc. and Anatek &quot;Pocket Mac&quot; interfaces, they all work fine. The MIDI software in the LanBox-LC is a standard, built-in feature.</p>					<p>If you want to use the serial port with a Macintosh you'll need a Macintosh serial cable (mini-DIN to mini-DIN). Windows users need our special LanBox &lt;-&gt; PC cable. Serial communication is a standard, built-in feature.</p>					<p>If you have DMX devices that work with a 5-pole XLR connector or a 3-pole, non Martin connector, you'll need an adapter cable. See &quot;<a href="chapter2.html#6">About Fixtures and DMX</a>&quot; (or the included paper) about the correct pinning of the LanBox-LC DMX cable.</p>					<p>We don't sell any lighting equipment other than our 788-LD digital dimmer pack. There are plenty of companies that sell or rent all sorts of DMX-512 lighting equipment. To help you get started you will find some links on our web site.</p>					<p>&nbsp;<br>					&nbsp;</p>					<p><b><a name="3"></a>Additional software and new versions</b></p>					<p>When we ship the LanBox-LC we'll put the latest release of all bundled software in the box. However, because we will continue to develop additional features for the LanBox-LC, you can expect new versions, new examples on how to use the LanBox-LC from various software environments and supporting software at a regular basis. All these new developments will be available on our web site and can be downloaded for free.</p>					<p>We will keep you posted (through e-mail) about new developments, available software and planned revisions.
